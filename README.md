CppFileCreator
==============

I love make all the functions of my class on the .hpp/.h before coding in the .cpp, but sometime it's very long to copy...

So I made this little program to convert easily .hpp/.h to .cpp :)



How To Use
----------

- Struct in class aren't supported
- Template aren't supported
- Crazy Multi-lines comments aren't supported
