Hi !

In this "tutorial", I will show you how to convert a class.

I've choose StateStack.hpp, a file from SFML Game Development Book (https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML-Game-Development-Book)

1 - Start
---------

See StateStack-.hpp to see it before any convertions.


2 - Manual Convertions
----------------------

You need to apply some changes to the file before the convertion.
See StateStack.hpp


3 - Run CppFileCreator !
------------------------

See StateStack.cpp



----------------------
4 - Write your code :)
